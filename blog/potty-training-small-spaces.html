            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section class="post-intro">
                <p>You're ready to start toddler potty training, but you live in a camper, apartment, or tiny home where the bottomless method just isn't realistic. Good news: you can absolutely succeed at potty training in small spaces without going naked-all-day. Below are five practical strategies you can use today.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Main Content -->
            <section class="post-content">
                <h2>Why small spaces make potty training harder</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited floor protection and shared carpets</li>
                    <li>No easy outdoor "learning zone"</li>
                    <li>Bathroom may feel far or intimidating</li>
                    <li>Constant proximity increases pressure for everyone</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategy 1: Scheduled sits (with flexibility)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try sits after wake, after meals, mid‑morning, mid‑afternoon, and before bed</li>
                    <li>Keep them short: 3–5 minutes, pressure‑free</li>
                    <li>Track times and successes to spot patterns</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Post a simple visual schedule at your child's eye level.
                </div>

                <h2>Strategy 2: Smart clothing choices (no bottomless needed)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elastic waistbands; skip snaps, zips, overalls</li>
                    <li>Consider daytime pull‑ups as a bridge while you build skills</li>
                    <li>Invite choice: "Which big‑kid pants today?"</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategy 3: Portable potty station</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Child-size potty in the main living area</li>
                    <li>Mini caddy: wipes, hand sanitizer, lidded trash, waterproof mat</li>
                    <li>Make emptying part of the routine</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategy 4: Accident‑proof your space</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterproof pads under the potty and favorite seats</li>
                    <li>Keep enzyme cleaner, paper towels, spare clothes handy</li>
                    <li>Treat accidents as data, not disasters</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategy 5: Consistency across caregivers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share a one‑page plan: schedule, language, what works/doesn't</li>
                    <li>Use the same phrases: "potty time," "try first, then play"</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The challenge with all these strategies? Staying consistent</h2>
                <p>The methods work—the hard part is remembering sits, logging accidents, and adjusting based on patterns when life is hectic in a small space.</p>

                <h2>Making It All Work: Your Potty Training Partner</h2>
                <p>The strategies above work. What makes the difference is having a system that keeps you consistent and adapts to your reality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time reminders for scheduled sits</strong> — never miss a potty time</li>
                    <li><strong>Accident tracking that reveals patterns</strong> — adjust based on real data</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalized guidance for small-space training</strong> — not generic tips</li>
